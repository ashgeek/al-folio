##### **Bio**
Hi! I am a third-year PhD student at [National University Of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg/){:target="\_blank"}. I am doing my thesis with [Prateek Saxena](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~prateeks/){:target="\_blank"}. My current focus is private computations on graphs, I am also interested in building usable systems for privacy. I opine that rigourous user privacy and monetizing users’ data can and should co-exist.

I have experience in program analysis and security of blockchains also, as indicated by most of my existing publications. However, I have parted ways with them for a while now :)

##### **History**
In 2017, I graduated from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"} where I was fortunate to work with [Indranil Saha](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/users/isaha/){:target="\_blank"}. I visited Prateek in 2017 for an internship before joining him as an advisee.

##### **Work**
I was fortunate to work with two exciting companies, [Flipkart India](https://www.flipkart.com/){:target="\_blank"} and [Aqilliz](https://aqilliz.com/){:target="\_blank"}. Flipkart India (now owned by Walmart) gave me an opportunity to work on their anomaly detection engine. Aqilliz is an exciting startup from Singapore where I had a chance to demonstrate the impact of applying Differential Privacy protection on the utility of widely-used queries like recommendations.

##### **Other interests**
My interests range widely from Computer Science to Psychology, Astronomy, Music, Cricket and Animals. I love singing and relish performing almost anything on a stage(of course after practicing….). I will probably stay in Singapore for at least another three years, so, If you are here then feel free to drop by and say hoi.
