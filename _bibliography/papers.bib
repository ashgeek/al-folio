    abstract = {In the last decade, several permissionless proof-of-work blockchain protocols have focused on scalability. Since these protocols are very difficult to change once deployed, their robustness and security are of paramount importance. This paper summarizes the desired end properties of blockchain consensus protocols and sheds light on the critical role of theoretical analyses of their design. We summarize the major paradigms in prior constructions and discuss open issues in this space.},

    abstract = {Smart contracts---stateful executable objects hosted on blockchains like Ethereum---carry billions of dollars worth of coins and cannot be updated once deployed. We present a new systematic characterization of a class of trace vulnerabilities, which result from analyzing multiple invocations of a contract over its lifetime. We focus attention on three example properties of such trace vulnerabilities: finding contracts that either lock funds indefinitely, leak them carelessly to arbitrary users, or can be killed by anyone. We implemented Maian, the first tool for specifying and reasoning about trace properties, which employs interprocedural symbolic analysis and concrete validator for exhibiting real exploits. Our analysis of nearly one million contracts flags 34, 200 (2, 365 distinct) contracts vulnerable, in 10 seconds per contract. On a subset of 3, 759 contracts which we sampled for concrete validation and manual analysis, we reproduce real exploits at a true positive rate of 89%, yielding exploits for 3, 686 contracts. Our tool finds exploits for the infamous Parity bug that indirectly locked $200 million US worth in Ether, which previous analyses failed to capture.},

    abstract = {We investigate a family of bugs in blockchain-based smart contracts, which we dub event-ordering (or EO) bugs. These bugs are intimately related to the dynamic ordering of contract events, i.e. calls of its functions, and enable potential exploits of millions of USD worth of crypto-coins. Previous techniques to detect EO bugs have been restricted to those bugs that involve just one or two event orderings. Our work provides a new formulation of the general class of EO bugs arising in long permutations of such events by using techniques from concurrent program analysis. The technical challenge in detecting EO bugs in blockchain contracts is the inherent combinatorial blowup in path and state space analysis, even for simple contracts. We propose the first use of partial-order reduction techniques, using automatically extracted happens-before relations along with several dynamic symbolic execution optimizations. We build EthRacer, an automatic analysis tool that runs directly on Ethereum bytecode and requires no hints from users. It flags 8% of over 10, 000 contracts analyzed, providing compact event traces (witnesses) that human analysts can examine in only a few minutes per contract. More than half of the flagged contracts are likely to have unintended behaviour.},

    abstract = {Automatic patch generation can significantly reduce the window of exposure after a vulnerability is disclosed. Towards this goal, a long-standing problem has been that of patch localization: to find a program point at which a patch can be synthesized. We present PatchLoc, one of the first systems which automatically identifies such a location in a vulnerable binary, given just one exploit, with high accuracy. PatchLoc does not make any assumptions about the availability of source code, test suites, or specialized knowledge of the vulnerability. PatchLoc pinpoints valid patch locations in large real-world applications with high accuracy for about 88% of 43 CVEs we study. These results stem from a novel approach to automatically synthesizing a test-suite which enables probabilistically ranking and effectively differentiating between candidate program patch locations.},

    abstract = {Programming by Example (PBE) is a program synthesis paradigm in which the synthesizer creates a program that matches a set of given examples. In many applications of such synthesis (e.g., program repair or reverse engineering), we are to reconstruct a program that is close to a specific target program, not merely to produce some program that satisfies the examples seen. In such settings, we wish that the synthesized program generalizes well, i.e., has as few errors as possible on the unobserved examples capturing the target function behavior. In this paper, we propose the first framework (called SynGuar) for PBE synthesizers that guarantees achieving low generalization error with high probability. Our main contribution is a procedure to dynamically calculate how many additional examples suffice to theoretically guarantee generalization. We show how our techniques can be used in 2 well-known PBE synthesis approaches: PROSE and STUN (synthesis through unification), for common string-manipulation program benchmarks. We find that often a few hundred examples suffice to provably bound generalization error below 5% with high > 98%) probability on these benchmarks. Further, we confirm this empirically: SynGuar significantly improves the accuracy of existing synthesizers in generating the right target programs. But with fewer examples chosen arbitrarily, the same baseline synthesizers (without SynGuar) overfit and lose accuracy.},

    abstract = {Analyzing structural properties of social networks, such as identifying their clusters or finding their most central nodes, has many applications. However, these applications are not supported by federated social networks that allow users to store their social links locally on their end devices. In the federated regime, users want access to personalized services while also keeping their social links private. In this paper, we take a step towards enabling analytics on federated networks with differential privacy guarantees about protecting the user links or contacts in the network. Specifically, we present the first work to compute hierarchical cluster trees using local differential privacy. Our algorithms for computing them are novel and come with theoretical bounds on the quality of the trees learned. The private hierarchical cluster trees enable a service provider to query the community structure around a user at various granularities without the users having to share their raw contacts with the provider. We demonstrate the utility of such queries by redesigning the state-of-the-art social recommendation algorithms for the federated setup. Our recommendation algorithms significantly outperform the baselines which do not use social contacts and are on par with the non-private algorithms that use contacts.},
